// Create a class called Complex, which has three private instance variables â€“real and imaginary. It contains a method called add( ) which takes one Complex object as parameter and print the added value of the calling Complex object and passes Complex object. In the main method, declare two Complex objects and assign values using constructor and call the add() method.
